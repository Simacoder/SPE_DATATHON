# SPE DSEATS AFRICA - DATATHON 2025 BY DATA PHANDAS

## 1.0 General Guidelines
### 1.1 Overview

The Society of Petroleum Engineer (SPE) Data Science and Engineering Analytics Technical Section (DSEATS) Africa Datathon Challenge presents an exciting opportunity for participants to harness the power of machine learning to address real-world challenges in the oil and gas industry. Organized by SPE DSEATS Africa Region, this challenge aims to leverage historical production data to accurately classify a group of 20 wells based on their observed performance trends.
### 1.2 Challenge Objective
- Participants are expected to work in teams of 3 to 5 persons (max) from at least 2 different organizations and/or schools to develop a machine learning (ML) model that accurately categorizes the 20 wells provided in the dataset by analysing their daily production data trends. The teams should explore innovative approaches to accurately categorize or classify the wells.

### 1.3 Key Components

- **Historical Production Data**: Participants will have access to a dataset containing historical production records, including production date, onstream hours, cumulative oil, gas and water production, choke size, bottom hole pressure and temperature, wellhead pressure and temperature and annulus pressure.

- **Evaluation Criteria**: Submissions will be evaluated based on the accuracy and reliability of the classification models, the creativity and effectiveness of the approaches employed as well as the level of collaboration amongst team members.

### 1.4 How to Participate

**Step 1**: Register individually using the link below
[Register](https://bit.ly/DSEDATA2)

- Interested individuals can register for the challenge by clicking on the registration link above and thereafter shall be provided with the dataset and competition guidelines.

**Step 2**: Go through the provided datasets, and the submission guidelines

- Please read the general guideline and the submission guideline carefully and be sure to understand and accept the conditions stated in the guidelines. Teams who violate the guidelines will be automatically disqualified from the competition.

**Step 3**: Build ML model to analyze the datasets provided and make classifications.

- Analyse the datasets provided following the standard machine learning workflow which should include (but not limited to): data preparation, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, modelling and classification.

**Step 4**: Submit your results as a team as per the Submission Guidelines below. Towards the end of the selection process, the top teams being considered for the awards may be invited for an online interview.

### 1.5 Eligibility

- All members of Society of Petroleum Engineering (SPE) affiliated with any of the SPE Sections in Africa are eligible to participate.

- Past winners of SPE DSEATS Africa Region datathon are eligible to participate however not more than one past winner can join a team.

- Close family and friends of SPE DSEATS Africa board members are not eligible to participate. 

### 2.0 Submission Guidelines

- Participating teams are expected to develop a machine learning model in Python programming language to accurately classify the group of 20 wells provided in the dataset. The ML model should be developed in the format of a Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file.

- The Google Colab file should be accessible and submitted alongside with the well classification (in csv format) and presentation slides summarizing the work done.

- Submission shall be on a team basis - individual submissions will NOT be accepted. Registered participants are expected to collaborate and form teams of 3 to 5 persons (max) from at least 2 different organizations and/or schools. Each team should adopt a unique but decent, single-phrase team name having not more than 15 letters/characters.

- Teams are expected to save the well classifications in a csv file with the following naming convention: **TeamName_DSEATS_Africa_2025_Classification.csv**. Adopt similar naming convention for both the PowerPoint slide and Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook file.

- Each team is expected to create a brief PowerPoint presentation of not more than ten (10) slides in total including the Title, Outline, Experimental Data Analysis (EDA), Methodology, Results, Contributions and Thank You slides. A “Thank you” slide is not necessary and can be omitted.
> ![NOTE]
> (*Note: Presentation slides that are more than 10 may result in deduction of points which will affect your team’s overall score*)

- The Title slide of your team’s presentation should be captioned (e.g Classification of Oil Wells in the DSEATS Field Using Machine Learning), followed by your team’s name, names of team members and their respective SPE numbers, SPE Sections in Africa that they are affiliated to, School or Company affiliations and date.

-The **EDA** slide(s) should show relevant statistical plots including well production profiles

- The **Methodology** slide(s) should show the ML workflow used to achieve the classification.

- The **Results** slide(s) of your team’s presentation should amongst other things show the estimate of the total oil produced (in reservoir barrels) from each of the 5 reservoirs


- The **Contributions** slide should summarize the work done by each team member.
- The PowerPoint presentation slide deck, the Google Colab file (or Jupyter Notebook file), and the Well Classification file in csv format should be sent to the email address below on or before the submission deadline: **Monday, 21 July 2025 by 11:59PM WAT**.
Email: speafricadseat@gmail.com (Note that submissions after the deadline will not be accepted)

- The Subject of the email should read as follows.
- Team’s Name_“SPE DSEATS Africa 2025 Datathon Submission”
e.g Innovisors_SPE DSEATS Africa 2025 Datathon Submission
- The body of the email should be in simple english as shown below.
**Dear Reviewer**,

On behalf of team (name), find attached to this mail, presentation slide deck, the Google Colab file containing our solution, and the well classification .csv file.
